# Continuous integration scripts
This allows the testing of various continuous integration scripts before 
committing to GitLab.
It is a major pain in the backside to debug against that so it is easier to do 
a test run before setting it up.

The various `run_<pipeline>.sh` scripts represent different scripts that can 
be run on different pipelines. 
The other scripts represent small sections that can be run in a pipeline.

Specifically:

- **run_docker**: mimics the `.gitlab_ci.yaml` functionality and runs the 
 docker locally. 
 This can be used to debug CI/CD gitlab builds without repeated commits.  
 This will create a container called and do the build before closing and 
 removing the container.  
 The container will also be removed on error.
- **run_pages**:  A script to initialise the dock building within the docker 
 container.
 This is designed to for local tests of gitlab CI/CD scripts inside the docker 
 container. 
 The script will source before_script.sh and pages.sh
- **before_script**: The before script is used by gitlab CI/CD and used to set 
 any commands necessary before running the script commands.
 Here it mostly installs the required python packages, as well as the package 
 being evaluated. 
 It also runs all the pytests for evaluated package.
 Essentially after this scripts completes, the package install has been verified.
- **pages**: Run the sphinx documentation and ensures these are published as 
 static webpages within gitlab.

To run a test build prior to committing:

```
# ./run_docker.sh <docker image> <repo root> <doc build dir>
./run_docker.sh floriaan1/plot-misc:master ~/google_drive/Research/plot-misc /path/to/doc/build/directory
```

**debug_run_docker.sh** wraps the above code in a executable shell script.
